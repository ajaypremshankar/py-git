# py-git
Python based git to:
1. Learn git internals better
2. Learn python as additional language 

### Commands implemented:
1. init
2. cat-file
3. hash-object
4. write-tree
5. commit-tree

## Testing locally

The `your_program.sh` script is expected to operate on the `.git` folder inside
the current working directory. If you're running this inside the root of this
repository, you might end up accidentally damaging your repository's `.git`
folder.

We suggest executing `your_program.sh` in a different folder when testing
locally. For example:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/testing && cd /tmp/testing
/path/to/your/repo/your_program.sh init
```

To make this easier to type out, you could add a
[shell alias](https://shapeshed.com/unix-alias/):

```sh
alias pygit=/path/to/your/repo/your_program.sh

mkdir -p /tmp/testing && cd /tmp/testing
pygit init
```
